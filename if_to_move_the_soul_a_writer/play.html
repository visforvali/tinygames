If there's a classical Indian analogue to European rhetoric, it's rasa aesthetics, always embodied and enminded. Wilke (2018) calls it "a concept of rhetoric which surpasses mere intellectual persuasiveness and conviction but includes body, mind, and intellect in a holistic manner." Banerjee (2004) describes it as an affective phenomenon of emergence, "an aesthetic gustatory pleasure and […] a cognition"—the indescribable flavor or essence imbued in a work by its creator. Rasa aesthetics produces non-corporeal affect through corporeal presence, inscribing emotion in craft, mediality, space, time, embodiment—be it anomalous or otherwise.

Distracted by the interminable onslaught of academic work, all of it presented like an emergency, I become less able to doggedly pursue healthcare while appearing less sick due to productivity, disqualifying myself as a good patient.

A bullfrog's croak, a cosmic borborygmi. Unlike the cry of the ulama, the demon bird, that roosted in Amma's backyard and screamed for three nights, and each following morning the sun rose on the news of a death on her street. The deaths end when Paata shoots it. It's largely agreed that, during the war, the fish were silent.

What kind of worldview is that aesthetics the logical outcome of? And more importantly, what kind of world does that logic help build?"
